    <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Priya Rajurkar</span></h1>
    <h4>
        
    <p>A passionate learner who enjoys building simple and useful tech projects. I love exploring frontend development, Android development, and Python-based applications.</p>

    <p>I’m currently focusing on improving my coding skills through hands-on projects like to-do apps, joke generators, and AI-enabled features.</p>

    <p>I enjoy turning ideas into working apps, learning new tools, and understanding how real-world systems work. I'm also working on improving my communication, English fluency, and confidence so I can grow in my tech career.</p>

    <p>I believe in learning by doing, staying consistent, and getting a little better every day.</p>
